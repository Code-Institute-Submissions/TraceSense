## Introduction

Tracesense is an application used for conducting GMP(good manufacturing practice) audits electronically. Tracesense will allow the user to complete the audit via a tablet, phone, or PC and there is no installation required.<br> Tracesense also allows for completing glass and hard plastic audits which is a food safety requirement.

<strong>Tracesense software provides insight and visibility to help raise quality and safety standards across an organisation.</strong> 

Tracesense will record your non compliant items and email them to a specific recipient list at your request to action. 

The benefits of using our software is that it's lightweight, simple to set up and helps eliminate paperwork which has an environmental benefit, but also helps with food compliance. Our software is not over priced and developed by a developer who has over 10 years experience in the food manufacturing industry.

Tracesense is my own company i created in November 2019 and decided to go with that name for the software although this application purely created for educational purposes at this stage.
